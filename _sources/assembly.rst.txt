Introduction
============
This document describes the procedure for assembly of the three subunits; `Optics Assembly`_, `Detector Assembly`_, and `Control Assembly`_ that will become one unit of the DMS ready for installation. Objective is to build a single item ready as a simple retro-fit to fluid dispensers already in field use.


Optics Assembly
===============
For this sub-assembly, you will need the items as listed in :numref:`Optics Assembly Parts and Equipment` and the associated referenced tools or supplies. In general, the items are listed in the order they will be assembled. More complete details on each item, such as part number, vendor etc., is located in the master BOM maintained here `7818-Droplet SVN\\trunk\\Documents\\7819 DMS Master BOM.xls`, and it can be :download:`downloaded here <7819 DMS Master BOM.xls>` (for **viewing** only).

Glue Parts
----------

Before beginning the full assembly, a few items need to be glued using either Loctite 430 or 5-minute epoxy. Set up a clean area and wear protective gloves as necessary.

#. Glue the 1/2" square aluminum mirror to the pocket inside the Optic Spine using Loctite 430 Instant Adhesive, or other appropriate cyanoacrylate. Apply 	a small drop of the glue, then slide the mirror into place. Make sure the mirror rest under the back ridges as shown in :numref:`square-mirror`.

	.. figure:: images/Square-Mirror.png

		:alt: Glue Square Mirror
		:name: square-mirror

		Glue the 1/2" Square Mirror to the Optic Spine

#. Glue the .0625 x .375 Dowel Pins in the pocket on the Optic Spine and in the pocket on the X-Y-Z Mount as shown in :numref:`dowel-pins`. Apply a small	drop of Loctite 430 and use tweezers to place and separate the Dowel Pins. It is important not to allow glue to get on top of the Pins.

	.. figure:: images/dowel-pins.png
		:scale: 100 %
		:alt: Dowel Pins
		:name: dowel-pins

		Glue the Dowel Pins to Optic Spine and X-Y-Z Mount

#. Glue the 1/8 x 1/4 Alloy Dowel Pin into the holes on the Optics Sub-Assembly Mount. Place a small dab of glue in each hole and insert pin to dry. Keep the area outside of the hole clean and free from glue. :numref:`mount`.

	.. figure:: images/mount.png

		:alt: Dowel Pins
		:name: mount

		Glue the Dowel Pins into the Optics Sub-Assembly Mount

#. Use the 5-minute epoxy as directed to glue the Collimating Mirror to the Optic Spine. Align the mirror in the slot, 	with the mirror side facing the 1/2" square mirror. Dab a bit of glue on the corners. Make sure glue doesn't run or leek to smudge the mirror. Set aside unbothered and allow for the glue to dry. :numref:`coll-mirror`.

		:name: coll-mirror

		Glue the Collimating Mirror to the Optic Spine

#. Use the 5-minute epoxy to glue the Housing Window onto the open slot on the outside of the Optics Housing Base. Put a small dab of glue in each corner, then gently	place Housing Window onto slot. :numref:`housing-window`.

Assemble Parts
--------------

Make sure all glue is dry and glued items are secure and properly placed before beginning this full assembly of the Optics.

#. Insert the 2 .112-40 .5625 Flat Head Screws into the two holes of the X-Y-Z Mount as shown in :numref:`XYZ-mount`. They will remain free floating during assembly of the X-Y-Z Mount to the X-Y-Z Adaptor.

	.. figure:: images/mount2.png
		:scale: 100 %
		:alt: XYZ-mount
		:align: left
		:name: XYZ-mount

		Insert the 4-40 Flat Head Screws on the X-Y-Z Mount

#. Place the X-Y-Z Adaptor over the flat head screws, lining up the holes as shown in :numref:`XYZ`.

	.. figure:: images/XYZ.png
		:scale: 100 %
		:alt: XYZ
		:align: center
		:name: XYZ

		Align the X-Y-Z Adaptor to the X-Y-Z Mount

#. Assembly the X-Y-Z Adaptor and X-Y-Z Mount together using 2 of the Tension Springs and 4 of the .086-56 x .375 Socket Head Set Screws. Using tweezers drop the Tension Spring through the hole using the Socket Head Screw to hold up the spring. Support the Tension Spring with your finger then flip the pieces over. Use needle nose pliers or other support tools to slide the other Socket Head Screw through the other loop of the spring, securing the spring in place. Repeat with the other hole. :numref:`Springs`

	.. figure:: images/Springs.png

		:name: Springs

		Assembly the Adaptor and Mount using the Tensions Springs and Set Screws

#. Place the now assembled X-Y-Z Mount and Adaptor on the Optic Spine as shown in :numref:`Springs3`, lining up the holes that correspond on the Optic Spine. Repeat the steps with the Set Screws and Tensions Springs to assemble the parts together. Note: it is easiest to start by dropping the 1st Spring through the hole on the inside of the Optic Spine as shown in :numref:`Springs2`

#. Insert the Cone and Oval Point Set Screws in the threaded holes on the X-Y-Z Mount as shown in :numref:`Cone-Oval`

	.. figure:: images/Cone-Oval.png
		:scale: 100 %

		:name: Cone-Oval

		Insert the Cone and Oval Point Set Screws as indicated

#. Adjust the Cone and Oval Point Set Screws so that the X-Y-Z Mount and Adaptor plate are parallel to each other and spaced about 2.5 mm apart and the Mount-Adaptor assembly is parallel and about 3 mm spaced from the Optic Spine as in :numref:`tension`. This helps set the unit up for the :doc:`calibration` procedure later.

Cables
======

This section informs of the construction of the two cables used as part of the Sensor and Optics assembly. The entire installation of the DMS requires an additional 2 cables to power the control board and connect to a computer. Those two are reviewed further in the :ref:`installation` section of this document.

.. _Laser Power Cable:

**Control Board to Laser Cable**

Cut the PS/2 MDIN-6 Male to Male Cable to 20" in length and solder to a 3.5MM 2pos Terminal Block as indicated in the schematic. Then attach the 5V and Ground cable to the two lead wires on the laser. :numref:`laser-cable2` The original cable schematic lives here: `\\Olympus\Departments\Electronics_Design\PROJECTS\7819-Droplet-II\Released_Circuits\7819-01xx_Cables\7819-0102_Laser-Power\Rev-A`

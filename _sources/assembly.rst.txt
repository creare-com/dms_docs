Introduction
============
This documents describes the procedure for assembly of the three subunits that
will become one unit of the DMS ready for installation. Objective is to build
a single item ready as a simple reto-fit to fluid dispensers already in field use.

Optics Assembly
===============
For this subassembly, first ensure you have all items as listed in :numref:`Optics Assembly Parts and Equipment` and 
the associated referenced tools or supplies. More complete details on each item, such as part number, 
vendor etc., is located in the master BOM maintained here `7818-Droplet SVN\\trunk\\Documents\\7819 DMS Master BOM.xls`, 
and it is mirrored :download:`here <7819 DMS Master BOM.xls>` (for **viewing** only).

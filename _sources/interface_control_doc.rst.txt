Introduction
============

This document describes the communication protocols used between the DMS controller (hereafter simply referred to as the DMS), 
and the host computer.  It partially replicates information found in the header file, dmsCodes.h, found in the ‘Shared’ area 
of the source code tree.  Every effort has been made to make these two documents agree, but in the case of disagreement
dmsCodes.h, and thus the source code, prevail.
 
USB Interface
=============
Communication between the DMS and the host PC occurs over a USB 2.0, Full speed (12 Mbps) connection.  Creare recommends, 
and our example code utilizes, Microsoft’s WinUSB driver system, but the interface is generic USB and so any low level USB 
access library, such as lib-usb, could be used.

The vendor ID is currently 0xABCD.  This is a bogus vendor ID, because at this time Creare is not registered with the USB 
Implementers Forum.  However, it is adequate for non-public device deployment.  The product ID is 0x7819.

Two endpoints are defined.  Endpoint 0 is the standard control endpoint required for all USB devices.  The DMS makes use 
of this endpoint to receive commands and return results.

Endpoint 1 is a standard bulk endpoint.  This endpoint is used to stream raw data samples from the DMS to the host, 
for example in alignment mode.  The DMS has no support for bulk streaming to the device.

Note that in all cases, all data elements are transmitted and received in LSB (little endian) format.

Endpoint 0 Commands
===================

The DMS supports the commands shown in Table 1.  Note that these are ‘Vendor’ Device Requests; refer to Chapter 9 of the
USB 2.0 specification.  A ‘Read’ is defined here as the DMS sending control data back to the host (Device-to-host); 
a ‘Write’ is defined as the host sending additional data along with the command (Host-to-device).  If the length is 
0 the direction is immaterial.

Status
======

In response to this command, the DMS returns its current state of operation.  This command should be used 
to poll the DMS (~10 Hz) to determine the result of other commands.

ID
==
This command causes the DMS to return the build date and time of its firmware, and the unique
ID associated with the processor.

	:header: "Data Item", "Field Length (bytes)"
	:widths: 10, 5
	:name: Identification Data

	Build Date / Time String(Mmm dd yyyy hh:mm:ss),	24
	Unique ID (u32 x 4),	4

Config Get
==========

In response to the CONFIG_GET command, the DMS will return the current value of all configuration parameters.  See Table 7.7.

.. csv-table:: Configuration Data
	:header: "Data Item", "Field Length (bytes)"
	:widths: 10, 5
	:name: Configuration Data

	"Stream Diameter mils, (u32)",	4
	Number of Dispenses (u32),	4
	"Dispense Time, msec (u32)",	4
	"Dispense Period, msec (u32)",	4
	N Ref History (u32),	4
	User / Ref Mode (u32),	4
	
Please refer to the firmware specification for the exact usage of these parameters.

Config Set
==========

The host may overwrite the configuration parameters with this command.  The data provided
should exactly match Table 7.7.

Calibrate
=========

This command requests the DMS to perform a calibration operation.  The DMS must be in the READY state.
There are currently three operations defined, which the host may select via the wValue control parameter; see Table 7.8.

.. csv-table:: Calibration Operations
	:header: "Operation", "wValue"
	:widths: 10, 5
	:name: Calibration Operations

	RESERVED,	0
	Get Dark Level,	1
	Set Background,	2
	Calibrate,	3
	RESERVED,	4-65535
	
See the firmware specification for the full details of these calibration operations.

After the operation is commanded, STATUS should be polled to observed the return of the DMS to the READY state.  
If the error code is zero, then the calibration operation was successful; otherwise there was a problem that requires
operator attention.

Get Calibration
===============

The DMS returns the current calibration in response to this command. This is primarily for debugging purposes.
The calibration has the format shown in Table 7.9.  

.. csv-table:: Calibration Data
	:header: "Data Item", "Field Length (bytes)"
	:widths: 10, 5
	:name: Calibration Data

	Dark Level (u16),	2
	Background (384 * u16),	768
	Pixel Range (2 * u16),	4
	Bin Edges (2 * u16),	18
	Cal Image (2 * u16),	768
	Cal Center (8 * f32),	32
	Cal Sigma (8 * f32),	32
	Cal Amp Scale (8 * f32),	32
	Cal Lateral Scale (8 * f32),	32
	
Please refer to the firmware specification for the meaning of these calibration elements.

Store Calibration
=================

After the calibration is computed, it is held in RAM only.  After this command is executed the
calibration is written to non-volatile memory.

Monitor Dispense
================

This command instructs the DMS to begin monitoring the sensor for a dispense operation.

Get Dispense Data
=================

After monitoring is complete, this command causes the DMS to emit the last results of the operation.  TBD.

Stream
======

This command controls raw data streaming.  The wValue parameter controls the streaming: 0 halts streaming,
1 begins streaming, and all other values are reserved.  After receiving this command with a wValue of 1,
the DMS will begin streaming the raw data from the sensor to the host at the full, 1kHz rate, on Bulk Transfer
endpoint 1.  The DMS will stream packets of the form described in Table 10 until commanded to stop.  Note the 
DMS must be in the READY state to use this command.

.. csv-table:: Stream Packet Format
	:header: "Data Item", "Field Length (bytes)"
	:widths: 5, 10
	:name: Stream Packet Format

	Header (u32),	4
	Packed Samples (u32),	150

The header consists of two parts.  The upper 16 bits holds the value 0x7819, which may be used to scan for the start
of a packet if synchronization is lost.  The lower 16 bits contain trigger status.  Bit 0 is the pump trigger, while
bit 1 is the plate trigger.  Bits 2 through 15 are reserved.
